Optional analog-to-digital reference for studio journals. Opens native share options to save quick pointers, send reminders, record voice memos, or attach images—only if chosen. No accounts, no tracking. Journal works fully without it.
## Purpose
This repository hosts a lightweight, optional digital reference link for analog journals. 
It opens the device’s native share options so users can save text pointers, reminders, or media to their own apps. No data is stored or tracked.
